I preordered [Bayonetta](http://www.sega.com/platinumgames/bayonetta/)
immediately after a friend told me about how awesome it sounded. I had been a
big fan of the [Devil May Cry](http://www.devilmaycry.com/) series already so
it's not a huge leap that I would love this game since it seemed to take the
same attitude towards gameplay and style.

I **LOVED** this game. The gameplay is outstanding. It's just the
right length. It has tons of re-playability. It rewards you early and often for
good gameplay and the combo/ranking system is easy to understand yet super hard!
It's my favorite out of all of the combat-centric-stylized-combat games I've
played yet.

The gameplay feels like a fighting game. You have a TON of combos all made up of
the two attack buttons (Punch and Kick). Depending on what weapons you have
equipped you can do different attacks. Throughout the game you can earn weapons
that you can permanently equip. You start with guns on your hands and feet (as
you see in the videos for the game) and can earn stuff like a sword, ice skates,
shotguns (for hands and feet), a whip, etc. Also throughout the game enemies
will drop some really powerful (and often slow) weapons that you can equip and
use for a short time.

The dodging aspect of the game is the best part. Hitting the right trigger makes
your character dodge an incoming attack. The dodging works great and I never
felt like I dodged and got hit during the dodge (Plenty of times when I think I
dodged but Bayonetta didn't start the dodge before being hit but that's par with
the course). The enemies do NOT hesitate in attacking you even if you are
dealing with a different enemy. This makes dodging really important. If you are
in the middle of a combo and you here the sound of an off-stage enemy shooting
you with his angel horn, you better watch for the projectile and dodge at the
right time!

Two aspects make the dodging even more useful. If you dodge at the last second
(except in the hardest difficultly mode) you start Witch time which is basically
this games bullet time. You can hit projectiles back to their shooters, and
generally get some big combos off during witch time. You can also keep a combo
going during a dodge. If you are trying to pull off a A-A-A-B-B combo and have
to dodge during the third A just hold it down and continue the combo after
(hopefully during witch time!)

You do have an energy bar that can help you accomplish many times. By default
every full bar lets you do a torture attack on an enemy. These attacks DO stop
the battle for a second while Bayonetta summons some type of torture device and
does major damage to your current target with it. These all require some sort of
button mashing or stick spinning (I don't think it's too much though) and deal a
ton of damage. Your energy goes away a bit every time you're hit though so
pulling these off can be quite tough.

The only other use of energy comes from many accessories that you can buy. Most
allow you to hit A+B to use energy to do something, whether it's make you
invulnerable to one hit, or do damage, etc. This combined with your weapon
choice provide a lot of options in how you want to play. You can be more
offensive or defensive as you see fit.

I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed this game. As soon as Caitlin
finishes Mass Effect II I could see myself picking it up again to finish the
Non-stop Climax (hardest) difficulty mode. I submitted my Penny-Arcade contest
submission for beating Hard but I haven't heard anything yet about if I made the
cut to receive a shirt. I hope I did!
