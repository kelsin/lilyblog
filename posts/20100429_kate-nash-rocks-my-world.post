Saw [Kate Nash](http://www.katenash.co.uk/) last night at
[Great Scott](http://www.greatscottboston.com/) in Allston and the concert was
incredible.

New York band [Supercute!](http://www.myspace.com/supercute) opened the show and
despite going on pretty late, won me over. They live up to their name and
clearly like a lot of good music given their choices of covers. I did buy their
CD for $5 and can't wait to listen to it. One song they even sang while
Hula-Hooping the entire time (as seen below in my crappy iPhone photo):

Kate Nash impressed me even more than I thought she would. Her show was
awesome. She even had a
[broken ankle](http://twitter.com/kate_nashmusic/status/13040671420) and that
didn't stop her at all. After the show she seemed to be in a ton of pain so I
hope she feels ok and clearly I hope she realizes her fans loved the show!

She did a bunch of songs off the new album as well as a bunch off the first. She
included some of the awesome artsy things on the new album which I thought was
pretty cool. I did wish she played Mariella but all more reason to go see her
again right?

The band was awesome especially the drummer. Her songs groove so well and
hearing them played live for the first time was a real treat. She is a fierce
performer (which is what I was hoping for) and the show did not dissapoint in
the least. I would go see her again in a second.

More bad photos!
