So this morning I check my tracking info and it says that the package is in
Watertown MA and that the delivery date is Monday. I decide to call them and
find out if it's possible for me to pick it up. The automatic phone system says
"You're package is out for delivery".

This clearly makes me very excited.

When I get an agent on the phone I ask to confirm this and she says "Sorry, the
automatic message must be mistaken you're package is not out for delivery. It
will be there on Monday." After confirming this again and confirming that I
can't go pick it up I hang up.

We go out to breakfast, we get home to a notice on the door saying they tried to
deliver a package from Apple Computers.

I call them immediately and finally get someone on the phone. The nice lady (who
of course I didn't get the name of) says that they will get a research team on
it and try to find the package and get the driver to bring it back to my
apartment. I say thanks and she takes my phone number down.

Now that it's an hour and a half later I call back wondering about the status
and of course get run through 3 different people who all can't find a record of
any of what happened 1.5 hours ago. The most recent guy keeps saying that my
phone number might have been taken down wrong? WHY DOES THAT MATTER! We are
talking about the same package designated by my invoice AND tracking number. Why
should my phone number be required to figure out what happened an hour and a
half ago? Are all CS requests filtered by phone number and not package number?
He also had the balls to tell me that anything communication I would get back
should get to me by Monday and that they don't guarantee any communication back
on Saturday. WHAT??? We're talking about you guys screwing up and then your guys
telling me I'll get a call back soon about the driver bringing me my package!
Getting a call on Monday means NOTHING.

So now I "supposed" to have a manager call me back within the hour. I hope that
freaking happens. This is ridiculous. If UPS didn't TELL ME ON THE PHONE that my
package was not out for delivery I would have it by now. Not to mention calling
back to try and get a status is impossible cause apparently NOTHING of what my
first agent told me got saved to any type of note on my account.

**EDIT**: The Supervisor DID call me back thankfully. And she called back with
results. Before she even called me she knew that the package was at a UPS Store
ready to be picked up by me (all the drivers already returned)
