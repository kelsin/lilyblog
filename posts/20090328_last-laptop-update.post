So when arriving at the UPS location there is no one there, and no "front
counter" area at all. We eventually drive a couple of places and check out this
empty room that has some metal detectors in it but no people. I find a security
guy that chuckles at me cause he can't figure out why anyone on the phone well
tell me to come here to pick up a package since like... no one is here.

I call the 1-800 UPS number and get a great guy that puts me right through to
his supervisor and the supervisor immediately calls the UPS Center that I was
at. He puts me on the direct line with the guy at the center who is like "Cool
I'll come right out" and sure enough he does come out of the building with my
laptop.

So after a pretty busy week at work, with lots of laptop woes I do now have the
laptop and I'm writing this post from it. Hopefully I didn't lose any twitter
followers in the process! Now to install Logic and get some recording done
before the day is over!
