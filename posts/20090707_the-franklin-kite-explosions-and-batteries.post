Last night I went to the CD release party for a co-workers band:
[The Franklin Kite](http://www.franklinkite.com/). Their new EP "Explosions and
Batteries" is available on iTunes (search "The Franklin Kite") and
[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Explosions-Batteries/dp/B002DEUEWA/ref=sr_f3_1?ie=UTF8&s=dmusic&qid=1245720319&sr=103-1)
for those that are interested.

My co-worker asked me to help record some drum parts on my
[Zendrum](http://zendrum.com/) and of course I couldn't say no. I loved their
first EP a lot and was excited to be able to do some music again. I played one
of the 3(?) drum tracks in Antoinette and provided the drums from around 2:26
till the end on Pilot. The main reason he asked someone to come in and play is
that he wanted some fills on the end of Pilot. The result was pretty
awesome. The parts have been edited, I just slammed on my Zendrum for a while
and John edited out some bad spots and did some arranging of the parts. I was
really happy with the results. Seeing the concert last night definitely makes me
want to record some songs this weekend!

Overall I'm very glad I got to be a part of this EP since I'm a big fan of the
music. I'm enjoying every song on it and can't wait to hear what these guys come
up with next!
