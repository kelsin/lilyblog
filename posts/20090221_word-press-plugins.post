I've added three plugins to my wordpress install and I'm pretty excited about
all three.

##### [Twitter Tools](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/twitter-tools/installation/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/twitter-tools/installation/)

First we have a very complex twitter plugin. Along with the widget you see on
the right, this plugin also manages posting to twitter when I make a blog
post. I'm not using any other features but the plugin can post blog posts with
every tweet, a digest of every day's tweets, or a digest of every week's
tweets. This plugin does not support multiple widgets on the page (because it
does so much other stuff and saves your settings outside of widget settings) but
there are others that do in case you want to follow multiple twitter accounts on
your blog.

##### [WoW Armory](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wow-armory/)

Second we have a
[WoW-Armory](http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Bronzebeard&amp;n=Kelsin)
plugin which you can see on the right of the blog (below the twitter
plugin). Very simple install and this does support having multiple widgets with
different characters if that was important (eventually I will probably do that
with my alts).

##### [Related Posts by Tags Widget](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/related-posts-by-tags/)

This is a very simple related posts widget. It only displays on a single post's
page (so click on the post title to see it in the sidebar on the right). This
one is simple and just sorts by tag relations (not fancy keywords or
anything). It does what I want for now and if I see related posts not syncing up
I will fix it.

For now this settles my desire to install plugins. We'll see if I add any more
in the future :)
