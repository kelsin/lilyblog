Already had to add some more!

##### [Last.Fm Records](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/lastfm-records/)

This was the best Last.Fm plugin I found. I just wanted to display like 9 album
covers and that's it. This one worked first, and I tried about 6 of them before
this one. Most didn't look good or didn't have an option to remove the text. I
did end up editing this one though. Near the end of the file I changed
"plugin.php" to "options-general.php" to move the admin menu item from the
Plugins menu to the Settings menu where ALL of my other plugins put their
options page.

##### [Sociable](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/sociable/)

For a social bookmarks plugin I wanted the ability to display a list of small
icons and it had to have Twitter. After searching for a while this one satisfied
both requirements.

##### [Lightbox 2](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/lightbox-2/)

This one is pretty simple but it auto puts the lightbox affect on all images on
my site. I want to find a good gallery plugin too. Wordpress image handling is
very nice now but I need to find two features for my dad's site:

1. Auto handling of thumbnails and main size. If I upload a HUGE photo, I want
   wordpress to store this photo. Then make two different sizes of it to
   display. The main size like 800x800 and then a smaller thumbnail for display
   on a post.

2. I want it to be able to watermark the big photo, either on demand or saved
   onto it. Either way works.
