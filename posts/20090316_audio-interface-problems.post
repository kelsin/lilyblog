So a long time ago I had a Echo Gina 20-bit audio card. I recorded my first
album with it. It was great. I upgraded it eventually for a Layla 20-bit. This
card was also great. Both of these were PCI card devices and worked flawlessly.

Then college hit and I decided that I need a true 24bit high khz audio interface
so I sold the Layla and bought a MOTU Ultralite. Into the world of Firewire
audio I go. For the most part this card worked ok. I was annoyed at a couple of
the problems I had with it. First it would never work in WDM mode for Sonar,
only ASIO. At random times it also wouldn't work but not too often. I was using
it with a HP Firewire PCI card that had a VIA chipset.

Then I decided that when I got my Zendrum I would need to get a portable
solution. I decided to use my new work laptop that was a Intel Core 2 Duo
machine with 4 gigs of ram. Much better than my 2 gig Intel Pentium 4 desktop. I
bought my zendrum and BFD2 and took my work laptop home to install XP and a
bunch of software. Software all installed fine until I tried to install the MOTU
drivers. I got a blue screen of death. I was incredibly mad. I barely used this
card and now it won't work? For the life of me I couldn't get the Ultralite to
work right even when I got around the Blue Screen of death by rebooting the
computer a bunch of times and praying. Fed up I decided to sell it and a bunch
of other audio gear in order to buy a new sound card and a new Line6 Pod
(Upgrading my Pod Pro to a Pod X3 Live).

Ebay stuff worked out and I decided I would buy a Presonus FP10 since they were
selling really cheap and it meant I could sell off my Mic Pre-amps as well. This
is another Firewire card. When I first installed it I was thrilled. It installed
fine and had really low latency. As I played Zendrum more and more the sound
card would sometimes not work at all. No sound, no midi, no anything. I
eventually found out that these symptoms can mean a bad firewire chipset. I
ordered a new Firewire PCMCIA to replace the crappy Bestbuy Dynex card. I also
tried plugging the Presonus into my desktop. Even on the desktop some things
wouldn't work the way they should. I also discovered that BFD2 chokes on my
desktop as well. Latency was high and CPU usage was higher. My desktop is
seriously dead as far as sound production goes.

As I began to look at my situation I realized another big problem. The FP10
isn't portable at all. One of my reasons to record on my laptop is the Zendrum
might mean playing live somewhere other than my apartment. The FP10 really
doesn't solve this issue in a nice way. This and all of my firewire issues (and
the fact that Apple doesn't even have a Firewire port on the new Macbook's) made
me decide to return the Presonus using Musician's Friend's return policy. I
haven't even gotten my new PCMCIA card yet but I'm pretty sure this is the right
choice.

I'm also trying to figure out what I want to replace my Desktop with when the
time comes. Right now I have my Asus laptop (running Debian, going great) which
I love to work on and my work Laptop is a lovely Lenovo x61s with Debian. My
desktop mainly used to server as my music studio and also my gaming machine. My
gaming recently has largely come down to ONLY World of Warcraft (on the computer
at least). This makes me want to go Mac. If I switched my desktop for a Mac
laptop, I'd have a portable music studio that could play wow. My entire
computing life could be in a posix world. This sounds very enticing.

The problem I'm struggling with is justifying the cost. For the cost of a Apple
Macbook (or Macbook pro) I can build a SCREAMING windows system (top of the line
Nvidia card, 8 gigs of ram, etc). Is paying a ton of money for a Apple laptop
worth it? My co-workers say it is if I put a non-zero value to my time. That's a
good point. I've spent a lot of time and money into trying to get an audio card
working nicely in windows and been having many issues. Most are not huge but I'm
VERY sick of googling firewire cards to see what chipset they have.

My current setup: I'm now using the crappy audio interface that's in my Line6
Pod X3 Live. It can record my vocals and guitars (what I need anyway) and
playback latency is great. No problems when using my laptop. My desktop still
can't handle BFD2 so I'm afraid the current desktop really is dead to me as far
as music goes. I'm using my Korg Padkontrol as my midi interface. Ridiculous but
it works. This doesn't solve my long term problem of Zendrum playing live
though. I really don't want to bring my guitar pedal and midi pad controller to
a gig to function as a audio interface and midi interface. It will work for now
since I don't have anything better but eventually this needs to change.

What I'm thinking about: A Apple laptop with a nice small portable audio
interface. This does mean that I have to ditch my Sonar/Project 5 software which
would be very sad. I would want to keep using Rapture and Dimension of course
but since they have VST, AU and RTAS versions I feel pretty confident that I'll
be able to use them on anything. My current thoughts are pointing me towards the
Digidesign Protools LE series and getting a MBox2 maybe? I've heard these things
work really nice (and are stable) and then I'd have a Protools system if I
wanted to keep using Protools. I'm also heavily looking into Ableton and Logic
as other options. Clearly if I don't go Protools I would be able to try out
other audio interfaces. I'm looking at Edirol and Echo ones. Echo doesn't make a
non-firewire interface but I'm hoping that on the Macbook I'd have better luck.

Any advice? I'm looking for any options for audio interface and recording
software to use with an Apple laptop. I'm also open to going back to MOTU for
audio interface. Anything that's solid and works well with the Apple
Laptop. Solid enough to gig with!
