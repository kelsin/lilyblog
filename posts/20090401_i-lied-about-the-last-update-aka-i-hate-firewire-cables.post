title: I lied about the last update a.k.a. I hate firewire cables!

So when I got my macbook I spent all evening installing BFD2, Logic Studio (with
all content) and World of Warcraft (plus other blizzard games, go <a
href="http://battle.net">battle.net</a>!). The next day (Sunday) I immediately
started recording the proposal song.

First off the sound card did not seem to like being plugged in via the hard
drive. I didn't think much of it. Plugged the hard drive in via usb and sound
card via firewire.

Right after adding drums the sound card started producing static and heavily
distorting/detuning the output. I got afraid I was overloading the CPU/HD even
though neither meter was very high. I did a lot of testing but really couldn't
get anything working that whole day.

Monday night I decided to test everything and eventually ended up
uninstalling/installing the
[Duet](http://www.apogeedigital.com/products/duet.php)'s software (plus full
power offs in between of course). I also unplugged EVERYTHING including my USB
mouse. The only stuff plugged into my computer was the Duet, power, DVI adaptor
for second monitor and Ethernet cable. This let me play guitar for about 20
minutes before it started producing static again (I couldn't drum cause I wanted
to test without ever opening BFD2 and without using any USB midi devices). I got
fed up and send lots of emails describing what I did in detail to the Apogee
tech support line.

Tuesday came and the email back from Apogee impressed me. Basically it was like
"This could only be a bad unit or a bad firewire cable" which proves they
actually READ my novel's worth of emails I sent and actually had nothing else to
try. A+ to Apogee for not wasting my time!

I have no other 400-800 firewire cable to try but I did have my hard disk
plugged in via USB that I could test. So I plugged that in via the 400-800 cable
and sure enough in about 5 minutes I got the mac "Drive disconnected improperly"
message even though I hadn't touched the cable. This pretty much meant it has to
be my firewire port (unlikely) or the sound card.

This morning I returned the cable for another one at the Apple Store. I want to
take a second to talk about this too. I called at 8:45 to ask the Apple Store if
I need to print my emailed receipt to return the cable. They said no. They don't
open till 9am so I was very happy they answered the phone. When I got there I
said I needed to return an item and the guy said "You're the one who called?
Awesome, head right up and grab a new one and let me see the old one." I go pick
out another one and on the way down another employee said "You're the one
returning your cable?" to make sure I wasn't just taking it away. He said good
luck and when I got back downstairs the original guy told me to head to the back
counter and they had me all set. Sure enough the guy in the back was like "Here
you go" and handed me a new receipt for the cable and I was done. Talk about
efficient use of my phone call and multiple employees to make my experience
awesome. I love this place.

Anyway, since this morning I've been listening to iTunes on my laptop via the
Duet at work and no static so far. Lesson learned? Always have spare cables to
test with!
