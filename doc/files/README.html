      <h1>Lilyblog</h1>
<p>
Hey, this is a tiny blog engine inspired by <a
href="http://www.restafari.org/introducing-marley.html">Markley</a> and <a
href="http://github.com/cloudhead/toto">Toto</a>. This blog is meant to be
hosted in a git repository and served by a web stack with heavy http
caching. It was written in order to be deployed on <a
href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a>. Heroku allows you to push your git
repo in order to deploy, handles rack apps, and includes varnish in
it&#8216;s stack to handle HTTP caching properly.
</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>
I used to host my blog via wordpress and decided I wanted something
simpler. I didn&#8216;t need many of the features and didn&#8216;t want to
edit posts out of emacs anymore. No need to have dynamic code on the page.
</p>
<h3>Plain text posts</h3>
<p>
Posts are just flat text files with a YAML section at the top and a
Markdown section beneath. More on the post format below.
</p>
<h3>Tags</h3>
<p>
One of the few features I can&#8216;t live without is tagging. I
don&#8216;t care about categories (I had them in the first draft, but
quickly removed them since I don&#8216;t care about them). Tags are just
put into the metadata for the post, and while viewing posts by tags we use
a ruby grepping library to find the proper posts.
</p>
<h3>Search</h3>
<p>
This is basically the same code as tags, but we search for any file
including the word (could be the title, tag or body text). This was almost
no code to implement but does help me find post quickly. Also allows
someone to subscribe to my site without using a tag I&#8216;ve defined in
my post.
</p>
<h3>Feeds</h3>
<p>
There is a main blog feed, a feed for any tag, and a feed for any search
term. They are accessible at /feed/, /tags/<em>tag</em>/feed/, and
/search/<em>search</em>/feed/. They should be auto discovered by your
browser if you are viewing the proper page as well. These feeds are in rss
2.0 format.
</p>
<h3>Highlighting</h3>
<p>
Code highlighting is handled by Ultraviolet in the same format that is used
by the Codehighlighter rack plugin. I wasn&#8216;t able to actually use the
rack plugin and decided to just put the code into my post model. I
didn&#8216;t need many of the features of the rack plugin, but it is
awesome and I recommend it for anyone working with a rack app that wants to
take advantage of code highlighting.
</p>
<h3>Disqus</h3>
<p>
I decided to use Disqus for comments. I spent a while thinking about pros
and cons to the different comment systems, or just coding my own (Probably
including a database). I decided that the extra code / effort wasn&#8216;t
worth it since the end result would have less features. Hopefully Disqus
allows people to comment easier (OpenID and other login options) while
still allowing my pages to be completely un-dynamic.
</p>
<h3>Standards</h3>
<p>
The blog validates as XHTML 1.0 Strict and includes some helpful sitemap
and robots routes that will help keep your blog indexed and working across
browsers.
</p>
<h3>Emacs helpers.</h3>
<p>
I include some emacs helpers that will help you create a new post and stuff
like that. These aren&#8216;t included in the slug if you push to Heroku.
</p>
<h2>Post Format</h2>
<p>
Posts are placed in the /posts/ directory and have a special filename that
functions as the slug for the post.
</p>
<pre>
    20100402_example-first-post.post
</pre>
<p>
The first part is the date of the post (sortable), followed by an
underscore and then the slug of the post. This post is accesible at the
following url:
</p>
<pre>
    /2010/04/02/example-first-post
</pre>
<p>
The displayed title of this post does not need to match this slug at all
(my included emacs helpers keep them synced up however).
</p>
<p>
Only files with an extension of .post are used so you can make drafts just
by saving them as .draft (as my emacs modes expect) or anything else you
want.
</p>
<p>
The top of the post file is a yaml segment with metadata. This segment runs
until the first blank line. Following that is the markdown post. For
example:
</p>
<pre>
    title: First Post
    tags: hello, example-tag
    date: 2010-04-02 1:45am

    I love making posts using markdown!

    * Lists
    * are
    * easy

        :::ruby
        def example_ruby(code)
            &quot;is easy too!&quot;
        end

    ##### Headers

    Using H5 headers helps keep things cleaned, but this is up to you and your
    css you create for the blog.
</pre>
<p>
Once you create a post file it will be displayed by the site. Normally you
want to connect git pushes to the clearing of your http cache so that all
tag info is recreated.
</p>
<p>
I only designed this blog to use those 3 yaml attributes but you can put as
much yaml as you want as long as there is not an empty line included. Any
yaml attribute is available on the model in two ways. For example if your
post has this header:
</p>
<pre>
    title: Music Posting
    music: Kate Nash - Mariella
    date: Febuary 4th
</pre>
<p>
You can access this attribute in the view code as:
</p>
<pre>
    # The long method
    @post.meta['music']

    # The short method
    @post.music
</pre>
<p>
The method_missing method on Post looks up that attribute in the @meta
attribute returning MethodMissing if it&#8216;s not found. This means that
if only some posts have an attribute either use the .meta example or catch
the exception.
</p>
<h2>View Files</h2>
<p>
I use haml as a template engine but it&#8216;s easy to replace since
sinatra supports all of the major ones.
</p>
<h3>layout.haml</h3>
<p>
This is the main layout file displayed on every page (except feeds). Edit
this to add new features to every page.
</p>
<h3>feed.builder</h3>
<p>
The builder template file that handles formatting the feeds. Edit this if
you want to change the feed format.
</p>
<h3>posts.haml</h3>
<p>
This is the file that displays a list of posts. This is used on every page
that isn&#8216;t feeds or a single post page.
</p>
<h3>_post.haml</h3>
<p>
This is the main file to display a single post. It expects a variable
comments to be true or false. It&#8216;s true on single post pages and
false on list pages. I like display the full blog post on the main listing
pages.
</p>
<h3>Inline Templates</h3>
<p>
Technically the main template for a single post page ONLY calls the
_post.haml partial. Since it&#8216;s a one line template I include it
inline. You can delete it from blog.rb and add a new post.haml in the view
directory if you want to customize it any more.
</p>
<h2>Emacs Helpers</h2>
<p>
My emacs file can easily be added to your config by putting it in your load
page and adding this to your emacs config:
</p>
<pre>
    ;; Blog helpers
    (require 'blog)
</pre>
<p>
It will auto load when you need it. You call the blog-create-post function
to create a post. blog-open-post to edit one.
</p>
<h3>Editing posts</h3>
<p>
The editing mode is a mode inherited from <a
href="http://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/">markdown.el</a>.
